# tic-tac-toe
Various python programs that play tic tac toe.  
OOP-Tic-Tac-Toe.py is the final version.
I'm not sure if there's even a difference between the regular and "-runner" versions.  
Based on a program by Michael Dawson.  
tic-tac-toe.py is Michael Dawson's original prgram, unchanged.
Tic-Tac-Toe_basic.py is that version but with my comments.
