# tic-tac-toe
Various python programs that play tic tac toe.  
OOP-Tic-Tac-Toe.py is the final version.
"-runner" versions are unimportant, they appear to be artifacts of one of my old, inefficent workflows.
Based on a program by Michael Dawson.  
tic-tac-toe.py is Michael Dawson's original prgram, unchanged.
Tic-Tac-Toe_basic.py is that version but with my comments.
