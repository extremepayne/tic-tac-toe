Various python programs that play tic tac toe.  
OOP-Tic-Tac-Toe.py is the current version.
This version allows both players to be assigned as either human or computer players, and computer players have 4 possible levels of difficulty, ranging from "random" to "hard" (impossible). Once these have been assigned, a game commences, and the program ends with a prompt to play again. 

Though the basic program is more or less finished, it could use some cleaning up of the code and a GUI. 


"-runner" versions are unimportant, they appear to be artifacts of one of my old, inefficent workflows.
Based on a program by Michael Dawson.  
tic-tac-toe.py is Michael Dawson's original prgram, unchanged.
Tic-Tac-Toe_basic.py is that version but with my comments.
